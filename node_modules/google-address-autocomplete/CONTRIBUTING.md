# Contributing
If you want to contribute, by all means! I would love to make this package better, or fix things that need attention. Feel free to submit an issue or email me at [deric.cain@gmail.com](mailto:deric.cain@gmail.com).

## Working locally
1. You need to clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/dericcain/google-address-autocomplete.git`
2. Then `cd` into the directory and install all dependencies `cd google-address-autocomplete && npm install`
3. From the command line, enter `npm start` and rollup will start watching for changes.
4. Navigate to `contrib/example.html` and open that file in a browser. You should be able to make changes and refresh that page to see your changes.
5. Once you are all finished, run `npm run lint:fix` to fix all of the linting issues. There may be some that you have to manually fix.
6. Run `npm t` to make sure that all linting is good to go before you commit.
7. Lastly, run `npm run build` to build the code in the `dist` folder and your should be good to go!

If you have any questions on this process or know how to make it better, please let me know!
